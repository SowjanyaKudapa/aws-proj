ec2: virtual server in the cloud
     we run appliaction here, we maintain our database. i can store my files in ec2.

vpc: virtual private cloud
  it is isolated virtual network.
  which services is in vpc, we need to provide security.
  

openVPN:  when our applicatiion is in private server and we dont have direct access to connect it bcz it ignores. we can't interact with this appliacation through interenet
          so, we have 2 optiions 
          1. basion host : same as vpn, using ssh command we can connect to private server.
          2. open vpn : open vpn in public subnet, so i can have chnace to communication private subnet from public subnet.

Bastion Host:

load balancer: to distribute the traffic accross servers.

autoscaling: based on demand automatically increase and decrese servers.
               2 types:
                    horizontal scaling : maintaining servers
                    vertical scaling : we can chnage the configurations
in auto scaling we have policies:
     1.simple scaling :
     2.step scaling :companies are using step scaling now.
     3.target scaling :

Security Hub:

cloud watch: it monitors of our operational health. if cpu utlization increases to 70% i run a command in cloud watch to give a sms to my email and update servers.
     when we attach the cloud watch with autoscaling it increases and decreases the services automatically.
